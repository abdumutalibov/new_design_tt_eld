            We were able to try out the device and all the back office things we
            need. Our drivers were so happy to no longer waste a ton of time
            messing with tablets. If you want a reliable, easy-to-use device, TT
            ELD is where you need to go.‚Äù

            We are a power only company with 227 owner operators who started
            with another ELD solution and had nothing but problems out of it.
            When we realized that we as a company could not keep this up we
            reached out to TT ELD
